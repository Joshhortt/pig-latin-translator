_Branching, Arrays & Looping Practice: using the .forEach, .submit(), .toString(), .text(), .join()_,<br/>
_.split(), .push(), .shift(), .unshift(), .pop(), .toLowerCase, and also the .length property_<br/>
_and many more functions and methods in JavaScript_.

## About

_Write a Pig Latin translator or should we say an "igPay atinLay anslatorTray"? Read all instructions carefully before beginning_.<br/>
_**How pig latin works (rules)**_:<br/>
_First, here are the rules of Pig Latin_:<br/>
_-For words beginning with a vowel, add "way" to the end_.<br/>
_-For words beginning with one or more consonants, move all of the first consecutive consonants to the end, and add "ay"_.<br/>
_-If the first consonants include "qu", move the "u" along with the "q". Don't forget about words like "squeal" where "qu" doesn't come first_!<br/>
_-For words beginning with "y", treat "y" as a consonant_.

## Specifications Outline:

_1. if word begins with vowel append "way" to the end of the word_.<br/>
_2. If word begins with 1 or more consonant move all consecutive consonants to the end and append "ay"_.<br/>
_3. if firsts consonants include "qu" move "u" with the "q"_.<br/>
_4. Check for y in the word when looking for vowels as a stopping point_.

## Example Specs
